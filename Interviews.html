          <p class="card-text" id="interview-question">Congratulations on winning UEFA’s Best Player in Europe award. Was last year your best season ever?</p>
          <p class="card-text">Probably. In terms of trophies, I can say yes. Every year since I started to play football has been amazing, but this year was special. First of all because we won, for the first time in the history of Portugal, that important cup. For Real Madrid to win the Champions League again, it was an amazing year. I want to say thank you to my team-mates, thanks to everyone involved in the success of the national year. It’s been an amazing year. I’m so happy. But I have to mention these two other amazing players [fellow nominees Gareth Bale and Antoine Griezmann] because they played amazing too.</p>
          <p class="card-text" id="interview-question">How does winning an international competition compare to winning with a club side?</p>
          <p class="card-text">It was the first time, it’s always special when you win something for the first time. I’ve won the Champions League three times but my dream was always to win something for Portugal, with the national team, and that’s what we did. We won for the first time and the feeling is completely different. I was very emotional. I was thinking about my team-mates, my family – my whole family because we were all born in Portugal. So the feeling was a little bit crazy. I cried a lot. Sad moments, emotional moments, happy moments; it all happened in the same day. So it was unbelievable achievement, it was a special day.</p>

          <p class="card-text" id="interview-question">You won the most important trophies in Europe last season and now you have won the Best Player in Europe award. How do you manage to motivate yourself for this new season?</p>
          <p class="card-text">For me, every season is a challenge. Many people ask me how I’m going to motivate myself to win more things because you’ve won everything already. But football is my passion and I’m still able to make the fans happy. People love to see me, so I try to do my best, I try to score goals, to help my team win trophies, individually and collectively. Every year is a challenge, this year will be the same as the last 10 years. To score goals at a high level, maintain my performance, that’s what I try to do.</p>
